            My name is Harshita Dabir, and I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with
            a Bachelor&quot;s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in
            Business Operations Management. This combination has equipped me
            well for a fast-paced and dynamic industry and has allowed me to be
            versatile within industries. <br />
            <br />
            Through various roles and internships, I have honed in on my skills
            in project management, supply chain engineering, data analysis,
            quality checks, and strong communication skills. These experiences
            have equipped me to create data-driven strategies to ensure growth
            and success in projects and team environments. <br />
            <br />I aim to devise and implement strategies that align with the
            companyâ€™s mission and ensures progress in the industry. I am seeking
            full-time opportunities to contribute my skills, driving growth and
            innovation.
